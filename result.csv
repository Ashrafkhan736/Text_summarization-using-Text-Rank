618,"While the whole world is fanboying over him and his fellow bandmates, BTS member Jin has never shied away from showing one celebrity he truly loves and is a massive fan of  The singer&#39;s love for Brad Pitt has also become &#39;worldwide famous&#39; just like his worldwide handsome title  Brad Pitt may have many fans but we bet there&#39;s no one as dedicated as Kim Seok-jin &nbsp;

Jin&#39;s &#39;Hollywood crush&#39;&nbsp;

It all started back in 2017 when Jin first namedropped Pitt and left everyone surprised  The Astronaut singer also received a rather funny reaction from his bandmates after he answered a question for an Access Hollywood interview  Jin created an iconic moment when he named Brad Pitt as his &quot;Hollywood crush&quot; and chose to name the actor as his favourite instead of any actress &nbsp;

Jin&#39;s dream collaboration&nbsp;

On another occasion, the singer once again proved his love for Brad Pitt and it was when the members were being interviewed on iHeartRadio Live in 2020 where they discussed their MAP OF THE SOUL: 7 album, their 2020 world tour, their new collaboration with Lauv, and more  It was during this interaction that the members were asked about future collaborations and whom they would like to work with next  The answers from the members turned out to be interesting as V name Ariana Grande, Suga picked Post Malone  Although when it came to Jin, the singer once again left everyone stumped with his answer when he said, Brad Pitt &nbsp;

Instead of picking another musical artist, Jin picked Pitt above everyone and that shows what a true fanboy he is of the Bullet Train star  His answer also provoked a response from RM who joked, &quot;He&rsquo;s gonna shoot a movie &quot; Although the thought of Jin and Brad Pitt acting together certainly left ARMYs screaming with joy given how they have been waiting to watch Jin explore his actor side as well &nbsp;

Jin&#39;s celebrity fans&nbsp;

While Jin may be a Brad Pitt fanboy, the singer and group members are themselves big celebrities and enjoy a massive celebrity fandom as well  From &nbsp;Thai actor Chalongrat Novsamron to Egyptian actress Somaya Elkhashab, there are many celebrities who have named Jin as their BTS bias  Also, TXT member &nbsp;Soobin, the leader of the group is a big fanboy of Jin  Soobin has not only mentioned how he is a fan of Jin&#39;s voice but also had the sweetest things to say about the BTS member as he said during a live session, &quot;Seokjin hyung is so handsome, he&rsquo;s really handsome  He&rsquo;s really likable, gentle and calm and&hellip;he has a face that I want to resemble  He&rsquo;s really elegantly handsome&hellip;I like him a lot&quot;, via All K-Pop &nbsp;

Not only that, but Coldplay frontman Chris Martin also has a special sport for Jin in his heart and it was evident during their recent show together in Argentina  In his introduction for Jin&#39;s performance, Chris opened up about how Jin had approached him about finding a song &quot;that says goodbye to everybody for a little while &quot; He said, &quot;And so, about six months ago, one of their members called me up and he said, &lsquo;I have to leave the band in December for two years, I have to join the army in Korea because that&rsquo;s the rule &rsquo; And he said, &#39;I need a song that says goodbye to everybody for a little while &#39;&quot; During the performance Jin and Chris were seen sharing a warm hug on stage as well, showcasing their adorable bond

jin&#39;s dream collaboration&nbsp;

on another occasion, the singer once again proved his love for brad pitt and it was when the members were being interviewed on iheartradio live in 2020 where they discussed their map of the soul: 7 album, their 2020 world tour, their new collaboration with lauv, and more  it was during this interaction that the members were asked about future collaborations and whom they would like to work with next  the answers from the members turned out to be interesting as v name ariana grande, suga picked post malone  although when it came to jin, the singer once again left everyone stumped with his answer when he said, brad pitt &nbsp;

instead of picking another musical artist, jin picked pitt above everyone and that shows what a true fanboy he is of the bullet train star  his answer also provoked a response from rm who joked, &quot;he&rsquo;s gonna shoot a movie &quot; although the thought of jin and brad pitt acting together certainly left armys screaming with joy given how they have been waiting to watch jin explore his actor side as well &nbsp;

Most popular Korean celebrities on IMDb

While the list was recently made public, what caught the netizens&rsquo; attention was spotting BTS&rsquo; V on it at a very high position  Essentially, a ranking of sorts gauging people&rsquo;s interest in Korean celebrities related to films, it was unexpected to spot the name of Kim Taehyung in it as he has never previously acted in a movie  While BTS themselves have released various cinematic collections of their concerts and their journey in the music world, none were ones that had them showcase their acting to the audience &nbsp;

First on the list is Park Chan Wook, the director behind mindblowing creations like &lsquo;The Handmaiden&rsquo;, &lsquo;Oldboy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Thirst&rsquo; and more recently, &lsquo;Decision to Leave&rsquo;  One of the most prominent personalities in the world of Korean film, he has upheld his name for quite a long time now  His depth in terms of understanding various dark stories and bringing them to life has been appreciated by critics globally  Leading the list is a very obvious pick for the 59 year old whose work people always look forward to 

Following closely behind is director Bong Joon Ho who has become a pioneer in the movie industry thanks to his contribution to internationally acclaimed projects like &lsquo;Memories of Murder&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Host&rsquo;, &lsquo;Snowpiercer&rsquo;, &lsquo;Okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo;  The last one earned a Palme d&#39;Or and 3 Academy Awards making quite the roar across the film fraternity  Known for his black humour and socially unique topics, he occupies the rightful second place on the list 

Steven Yeun grabs the third position owing to his notable roles in films like &lsquo;Okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;Burning&rsquo; as well as the TV show, &lsquo;The Walking Dead&rsquo;  He established himself with varied roles that allowed him to be considered for unique characters  His nomination as the first Asian-American actor at the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role has been immensely written about 

V takes fourth place on the popularity list thanks to his acting in &lsquo;Hwarang&rsquo; as well as the online presence he has built so far with his elegant, relatable and all-giving nature  Multiple international directions have previously expressed their interest to cast him  While he is yet to sign any films, fans are definitely looking forward to actor Kim Taehyung making a return to their screens sooner rather than later

following closely behind is director bong joon ho who has become a pioneer in the movie industry thanks to his contribution to internationally acclaimed projects like &lsquo;memories of murder&rsquo;, &lsquo;the host&rsquo;, &lsquo;snowpiercer&rsquo;, &lsquo;okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;parasite&rsquo;  the last one earned a palme d&#39;or and 3 academy awards making quite the roar across the film fraternity  known for his black humour and socially unique topics, he occupies the rightful second place on the list 

steven yeun grabs the third position owing to his notable roles in films like &lsquo;okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;burning&rsquo; as well as the tv show, &lsquo;the walking dead&rsquo;  he established himself with varied roles that allowed him to be considered for unique characters  his nomination as the first asian-american actor at the screen actors guild for outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role has been immensely written about 

v takes fourth place on the popularity list thanks to his acting in &lsquo;hwarang&rsquo; as well as the online presence he has built so far with his elegant, relatable and all-giving nature  multiple international directions have previously expressed their interest to cast him  while he is yet to sign any films, fans are definitely looking forward to actor kim taehyung making a return to their screens sooner rather than later

488,"January just became one of our favourite months of this year as a new collaboration was announced  BIGBANG fame, member Taeyang revealed and confirmed his upcoming song with Jimin of BTS and the fans of the two cannot stay calm  Here are all the details we know so far 

Taeyang X Jimin

On January 4, BIGBANG&rsquo;s Taeyang released a new teaser photo on his social media accounts, announcing his upcoming release  To be called &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo;, the song will drop on January 13 at 2 PM KST (10:30 am IST)  A collaboration between Taeyang and BTS&rsquo; Jimin, it is the first time that the members of the legendary groups are working together on a solo release &nbsp;

VIBE teaser poster

The teaser poster shared by Taeyang opens up in a yellow light setting where the two icons stand exuding their ever present charisma  The BIGBANG member, slightly bent from his waist is clad in a sleeveless jacket with multiple accessories around his neck and hands  His newly debuted long blonde hair is slicked back and it is one of the finest avatars we have seen him in &nbsp;

BTS member Jimin stands just behind him, propped on foot  Jimin&rsquo;s usual sensual presence is just as visible in this photo as he wears a shining leather jacket, loose black pants and chunky boots  The red and black theme is common on both the artists &nbsp;
Possibly, one of the most shocking collaborations to ever happen in the history of K-pop, &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; marks the amalgamation of the long-riding skills honed by BIGBANG and its members within its fandom ever since their debut in 2006 and adds the massive influence of BTS and the septet&rsquo;s individual talents since their debut in 2013 to bring forth a groundbreaking release that will definitely make for a drop being talked about for years to come &nbsp;

Taeyang&rsquo;s change to THEBLACKLABEL

BIGBANG member Taeyang recently announced his departure from his origin agency, YG Entertainment, with whom he trained and debuted  Taeyang decided to move to THEBLACKLABEL, the subsidiary agency of YG Entertainment and revealed that he will continue to be a part of BIGBANG&rsquo;s future group activities  His move comes at a time when the renewal of contracts of the group&rsquo;s members is being discussed and with Daesung also deciding to leave their parent company, now only the leader, G-Dragon remains 

As soon as he shifted to his new agency, Taeyang revealed new profile photos which were also shared by him on his social media  He sported the same look as in the image for &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo;, making fans anticipate his upcoming release

It was in early December of 2022, that the reports about Taeyang working with BTS member Jimin first broke out  While many found it hard to believe their eyes, others celebrated this unforgettable collaboration that was seemingly in the works  At the time, YG Entertainment responded with no confirmation and only asked fans to stay excited about the soloist&rsquo;s upcoming activities &nbsp;

&nbsp;

Just as his agency change was announced, Taeyang took to his Instagram to share a couple of photos  Captioning them &lsquo;#2023&rsquo;, it was obvious that the singer was raising the hype meter for his release  However, there was another person in the photos whose back was to the camera  Netizens turned on their detective sides and were quick to figure out that it was none other than BTS&rsquo; Jimin thanks to his hairstyle and adorable hands  The single was as good as confirmed now  To add to that, BTS member J-Hope clicked a like on the photo, which further solidified the fans&rsquo; thoughts &nbsp;

G-Dragon&rsquo;s support

Always the one to hype up his fellow members, BIGBANG leader G-Dragon shared a story on his Instagram account with THEBLACKLABEL&rsquo;s announcement of their new artist  He added a photo of himself and Taeyang to the mix, celebrating his fellow duo member&rsquo;s new start

Preview Photos:

In the preview image released on the day, V played a gentleman riding a horse or enjoying tea time against the backdrop of 19th century Europe  V directly participated in the overall pictorial work from the planning stage to express his own color  On December 8th, Mood Sampler #1 and #2 of V&#39;s pictorial project special 8 photo-folio &#39;Me, Myself, and V &#39;Veautiful Days&#39; were released on BTS&#39; official YouTube channel  In the released video, V caught the eye with a romantic and classic look  His fans praised her with comments such as &ldquo;He always delivers,&rdquo; &ldquo;He seems to have come out of a fairy tale or a movie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Each concept is art,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beautiful Taehyung &rdquo;

Mood Sampler 1:

In particular, this video was directed by V as a film director and perfectly reflected V&#39;s intention that &quot;I think classics are destined to come back to classics again &quot; &#39;Mood Sampler #1&#39; was held in the background of a garden with trumpets and birdsong and a window with sunlight shining through  When we saw V with neat and deep eyes through the leaves, the true beauty &#39;Veautiful&#39; unfolded  V&#39;s profile as he gazes at the leaves is a perfect beauty like a statue made by a sculptor with all his might, and his eyes contain a sense of nostalgia  It took his breath away when he saw V&#39;s delicate and graceful side profile while hearing only the sound of birdsong and turning the pages, as calm and slow as a slowly swinging antique pocket watch 

Dressed in a blue suit and white ribbon, V appeared in a classic, trendy, and unrealistic look at the same time  &quot;He proved what he said  The scene where V looks at the camera with a languid and dreamy gaze with his hands on his face under the sunlight at the window reminds me of an aristocratic young man in a classic British movie and completes all the fantasies of those who dream of romance 

Mood Sampler 2:

When &#39;Mood Sampler #2&#39; started, a romantic video of wild flowers placed on a white bedclothes came out  The appearance of V running with a flower in his mouth while looking up at the sky gave viewers a dazzling and colorful charm that goes back and forth between defenseless boyishness and bewitching beauty, making viewers fall in love

In the preview image released on the day, V played a gentleman riding a horse or enjoying tea time against the backdrop of 19th century Europe  V directly participated in the overall pictorial work from the planning stage to express his own color  On December 8th, Mood Sampler #1 and #2 of V&#39;s pictorial project special 8 photo-folio &#39;Me, Myself, and V &#39;Veautiful Days&#39; were released on BTS&#39; official YouTube channel  In the released video, V caught the eye with a romantic and classic look  His fans praised her with comments such as &ldquo;He always delivers,&rdquo; &ldquo;He seems to have come out of a fairy tale or a movie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Each concept is art,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beautiful Taehyung &rdquo;

Mood Sampler 1:

In particular, this video was directed by V as a film director and perfectly reflected V&#39;s intention that &quot;I think classics are destined to come back to classics again &quot; &#39;Mood Sampler #1&#39; was held in the background of a garden with trumpets and birdsong and a window with sunlight shining through  When we saw V with neat and deep eyes through the leaves, the true beauty &#39;Veautiful&#39; unfolded  V&#39;s profile as he gazes at the leaves is a perfect beauty like a statue made by a sculptor with all his might, and his eyes contain a sense of nostalgia  It took his breath away when he saw V&#39;s delicate and graceful side profile while hearing only the sound of birdsong and turning the pages, as calm and slow as a slowly swinging antique pocket watch 

Dressed in a blue suit and white ribbon, V appeared in a classic, trendy, and unrealistic look at the same time  &quot;He proved what he said  The scene where V looks at the camera with a languid and dreamy gaze with his hands on his face under the sunlight at the window reminds me of an aristocratic young man in a classic British movie and completes all the fantasies of those who dream of romance 

Mood Sampler 2:

When &#39;Mood Sampler #2&#39; started, a romantic video of wild flowers placed on a white bedclothes came out  The appearance of V running with a flower in his mouth while looking up at the sky gave viewers a dazzling and colorful charm that goes back and forth between defenseless boyishness and bewitching beauty, making viewers fall in love

1,"RM aka Kim Namjoon was the first member to join BTS. The group released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool on June 12, 2013. Apart from RM, BTS also features Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. In an interview with Hypebeast, RM said, ""This is the most difficult question to answer truthfully. Recently, I watched Everything Everywhere All At Once. That film visualized many of the ideas that I’ve had, such as the idea about multiple versions of myself existing based on small choices I made. I often think about what it would have been like if I continued my studies or became something other than a musician."" ""To be honest, one decision that I had often thought about was my choice to become a part of a boy band. In the late 2000s, musicians like Zico, Changmo, and Giriboy were the people that I started out with. In my journey with BTS, I drifted further and further away from that world and was tormented by the thought that the people that I liked – and the people who enjoyed the same music as I – did not have any love for me. I often wondered whether I made the right decision by joining a boy band. At the time, BTS, was treated like a complete outsider in the Korean hip-hop community. That stressed me out. I was constantly thinking about how I would be able to overcome that perception and how to define music or hip-hop,” he added. RM released his first solo mixtape in 2015. Three years later, he released his second mixtape, Mono. RM has collaborated with artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, Lil Nas X, Erykah Badu, and Anderson .Paak. Earlier this month, RM released his first full-length solo album Indigo.","the group released their debut single album 2 cool 4 skool on june 12, 2013. apart from rm, bts also features jin, suga, j-hope, jimin, v, and jungkook. rm released his first solo mixtape in 2015. three years later, he released his second mixtape, mono. rm has collaborated with artists such as wale, younha, warren g, gaeko, krizz kaliko, mfbty, fall out boy, primary, lil nas x, erykah badu, and anderson .paak. in my journey with bts, i drifted further and further away from that world and was tormented by the thought that the people that i liked – and the people who enjoyed the same music as i – did not have any love for me.","in an interview with hypebeast, rm said, ""this is the most difficult question to answer truthfully.

393,"Run BTS has been a place of comfort and respite to the fans of BTS who look forward to the group&rsquo;s goofy and human-like sides as they take a break from their usual superstar activities to play around  While a regular edition of the show has ended, the group often returns between their busy schedules and headline-making promotions to be their usual selves in special episodes aired every now and then 

RUN BTS TV On-air
A preview of the new episode showed the BTS members taking on the roles of live broadcasters which have become relatively common as more and more people seek a career in content creation  As the seven members, each took on their own specialities to become someone else for a day, their personalities were very visible  While one presented, the other six became the viewers and took on the job of communicating through comments only  Here&rsquo;s what went down with each of them 

Jungkook

While the youngest has often admitted to a lack of patience as he tries to learn things, he makes up for it by being good at all these activities right from the get-go  Jungkook has been interested in learning an instrument and it was the perfect fit as the BTS ARMY fulfilled their wish of seeing a rock-inspired Golden Maknae with this Run BTS episode  He took in-person lessons from a popular YouTuber &lsquo;Boogie Drum&rsquo; who taught the BTS member Butter on the drums  A super-focused Jungkook became the bane for the viewers aka BTS who bombarded his comments section with demands 

SUGA

The star rapper and producer promised to be more communicative and did just that as he picked up a brush instead of a guitar or a piano as most would have expected  SUGA began taking requests and the BTS member obliged with hilarious options  He finally decided to draw an egg and they kept calling him out for the lack of visibility and commented unfiltered making the painter lose his patience with them eventually, creating an even more comic scene  His attempt at drawing spicy noodles was funnier, even more so for the ones watching 

Jin
The BTS member has been known to spend a lot of time inside the comfort of his house playing away on his computer  Jin was given three games to try out and he began with a difficult-to-control skateboard game that he ended after flipping it twice  Next was an annoyingly difficult game for Jin whose secrets were unknown to others  Trying his best to control his emotions he tried his best but soon gave up  Onto the last game, a trick awaited in the form of horror as a round designed to fool the player was set up  The end was just as funny for the BTS member who was left alone as all the viewers but one left his chat room not letting him say goodbye  SUGA stayed back to support Jin and it was the most heartwarming moment of the episode 

J-Hope
A brief look at J-Hope&rsquo;s broadcast revealed him trying fun toys while the other BTS members cosplayed as kids  What will explode in this live? Part 2 will be released next week!
